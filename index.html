        <p>In a world with an ever-growing need for environmental research and action, tools need to be developed in order to facilitate the distribution and understanding of environmental data. As a field, environmental science has not yet had the impact it needs to have on the general public, mostly due to limited amount of exposure to the information. A powerful visualization tool would help bring all types environmental causes to the forefront by helping the general populations understand how the environment influences their day to day lives. This project seeks to achieve that goal by creating an open source environmental data visualization suite for researchers and data scientists.  The tool set will be especially tailored toward geographical and energy related data; however, the end project will create a much more versatile set of abilities.  This tool would make it incredible simple for researchers to submit any kind of geographic data and create meaningful visualizations of that data, without the need for much technical knowledge of the part of the researchers. </p>
